# Weather JS app

The weather JS app was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript! Check my previous repos for the [hiWeather](https://tgd-weather.netlify.app) App.

HOW TO USE: Type the city and country in the search box and press Enter. The weather details of the typed location will be displayed.

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Get an API Key

- Sign up for a free account at [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/)
- Navigate to your API keys section
- Generate a new API key (it may take a few minutes to activate)

### 2. Configure Environment Variables

- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Add your API key to the `.env` file:
  ```
  API_KEY=your_api_key_here
  ```
- ⚠️ **Important**: Never commit the `.env` file to GitHub (it's already in `.gitignore`)

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install dotenv
```

### 4. Run the Application

Open `index.html` in your browser to start using the weather app.
