# Weather JS app

The weather JS app was created using HTML5, CSS3 and JavaScript! Check my previous repos for the [VUEJS app](https://codepen.io/techgirldiaries/full/zYBMOrK).

HOW TO USE: Type the city and country in the search box and press Enter. The weather details of the typed location will be displayed.
